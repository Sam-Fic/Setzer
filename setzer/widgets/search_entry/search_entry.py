class SearchEntry(Gtk.SearchEntry):
    '''Thin wrapper around the standard ``Gtk.SearchEntry``.

    A plain ``Gtk.SearchEntry`` already provides the search icon, a built-in
    clear button, the immediate ``changed`` signal (from ``GtkEditable``) and
    the canonical ``next-match`` / ``previous-match`` / ``stop-search`` key
    bindings (Down / Ctrl+G, Up / Shift+Ctrl+G, Escape). The former custom
    icon handling, key controller and underscore signals are therefore no
    longer needed. The class is kept as a subclass so existing import sites
    continue to work.
